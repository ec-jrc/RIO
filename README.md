# RIO

The Remote InterOperability of the EC Joint Research Centre aims at providing a simple yet complete management for IoT and accessory implementations.
It is implemented as an operating system hosted by the native OS of the device, it is plugin based and multi platform, exploiting the features of .Net Standard and
.Net Core.

Implemented as a library, the RIO needs a launcher to be activated and to interact with online services.

RIO has been used for life savings technologies such as sea level measurements for tsunami early warning and alerting devices to warn the populaiton.
The related modules will be added to the repositories, when the related article will be published on CodeProject.
